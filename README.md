This is the CreateThis VR UI demo. Press in the upper right quadrant of your HTC Vive Touchpad or Oculus Touch joystick to see a panel with buttons.
Things of note:
* There is a full iPhone style keyboard in the Save As panel. Just click the FileName button.
* The panel is grabbable.
* The buttons are clickable just by moving the controller (no trigger necessary).
* There are two basic types of buttons: toggle (skybox buttons) and momentary (open and saveas, and keyboard buttons).
* All panels and buttons are made using factories. This means the materials and basic building blocks (background cube, etc) are fully interchangeable.
